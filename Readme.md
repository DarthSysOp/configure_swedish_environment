# PowerShell Script: Set System Locale, Language, Timezone, and Culture for Sweden
This PowerShell script sets the system locale, language, timezone, and culture to Sweden and Swedish. It provides a convenient way to configure these settings for systems operating in a Swedish context.

## Prerequisites
PowerShell version 3.0 or later
Administrative privileges (required to modify system settings)

## Usage
Open PowerShell.
Copy and paste the script into the PowerShell console or save it in a .ps1 file.
Run the script by executing the saved .ps1 file or running the commands directly in the console.

### Script Explanation
The script starts by using the Set-WinSystemLocale cmdlet to set the system locale to 'sv-SE', which corresponds to Sweden and Swedish.

It then uses the Set-WinUserLanguageList cmdlet to set the user language list to 'sv-SE'. This ensures that the language used for the user interface is also set to Swedish.

The script includes a commented-out section that lists all the GeoIDs for different counties in Sweden. You can refer to this section if you need to set a specific GeoID for a particular region. Uncomment and modify the relevant Set-WinHomeLocation line accordingly.

The script uses the Set-WinHomeLocation cmdlet to set the home location GeoID to 235, which corresponds to Sk√•ne County in Sweden. You can modify this line to set the home location to a different county if needed.

It then uses the Set-TimeZone cmdlet to set the timezone to "W. Europe Standard Time", which represents the standard timezone for Western Europe.

Finally, the script uses the Set-Culture cmdlet to set the culture to 'sv-SE', ensuring that the system follows Swedish cultural conventions.
